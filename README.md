Data analysis python project


## Aim of the project:
The objective of the present project is to extract and interpret data from a flat file database containing personal information about 500 individuals, and more specifically details such as CPR, first and last names, height, weight, eye color, blood type, and number of children. The goal of this project was to develop a program that reads the provided database, efficiently stores the data in a chosen data structure, and conducts targeted analyses to yield meaningful statistical outcomes. Emphasis has been placed on the meticulous extraction of data, with a focus on obtaining accurate and comprehensive information, rather than solely on the statistical analysis phase.

## Source of the data:
